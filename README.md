# Nokia SR Linux Local and Remote Mirroring

This lab can be used to explore the Nokia SR Linux mirroring capabilities. It includes different mirror sources (interface, ACL) as well as different mirror destination types (local, remote). The lab can be deployed and used as is, however, the crucial configuration snippets to get the mirroring up and running are listed below.

## Deploying the lab

The lab is deployed with the [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev) project, where [`srl-mirroring.clab.yml`](srl-mirroring.clab.yml) file declaratively describes the lab topology.

```bash
# change into the cloned directory
# and execute
clab deploy --reconfigure
```

To remove the lab:

```bash
clab destroy --cleanup
```

## Accessing the network elements

Once the lab has been deployed, the different SR Linux nodes can be accessed via SSH through their management IP address, given in the summary displayed after the execution of the deploy command. It is also possible to reach those nodes directly via their hostname, defined in the topology file. Linux clients cannot be reached via SSH, as it is not enabled, but it is possible to connect to them with a docker exec command.

```bash
# reach a SR Linux leaf or a spine via SSH
ssh admin@leaf1
ssh admin@spine1

# reach a Linux client via Docker
docker exec -it client1 bash
```

## Mirroring config
### Local mirror destination

On leaf1, we are making use of the local mirroring functionality of an entire interface. (It would also be possible to only mirror the traffic on sub-interface level, i.e. interface + VLAN combination.)
For this purpose, `ethernet-1/10` is configured as `local-mirror-dest` and a `mirroring-instance` is created containing `ethernet-1/1` as source and `ethernet-1/10` as local destination. The traffic will be sent to mirror2.

```
set / interface ethernet-1/10
set / interface ethernet-1/10 admin-state enable
set / interface ethernet-1/10 subinterface 0
set / interface ethernet-1/10 subinterface 0 admin-state enable
set / interface ethernet-1/10 subinterface 0 type local-mirror-dest
set / interface ethernet-1/10 subinterface 0 local-mirror-destination
set / interface ethernet-1/10 subinterface 0 local-mirror-destination admin-state enable

set / system mirroring
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 admin-state enable
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-source
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-source interface ethernet-1/1
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-source interface ethernet-1/1 direction ingress-egress
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-destination
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-destination local ethernet-1/10.0
```

### Remote mirror destination

On leaf2, the mirror destination is not locally connected but on a remote machine. In this scenario, the mirror source is based on an ACL entry. In the configuration below, the first step is to create an IPv4 ACL that matches ICMP packets (protocol 1) and assign it to the client interface `ethernet-1/1.0`. Secondly, the `mirroring-instance` is created using the ACL entry 10 as a source and specifying the remote mirror destination. The encapsulation type is `l2ogre` (L2 over GRE). The remote destination of the mirrored traffic is mirror1.

```
set / acl acl-filter mirror-acl type ipv4
set / acl acl-filter mirror-acl type ipv4 entry 10
set / acl acl-filter mirror-acl type ipv4 entry 10 description "Match ICMP"
set / acl acl-filter mirror-acl type ipv4 entry 10 match ipv4 protocol 1
set / acl acl-filter mirror-acl type ipv4 entry 10 action
set / acl acl-filter mirror-acl type ipv4 entry 10 action accept
set / acl interface ethternet-1/1.0
set / acl interface ethternet-1/1.0 interface-ref
set / acl interface ethternet-1/1.0 interface-ref interface ethernet-1/1
set / acl interface ethternet-1/1.0 interface-ref subinterface 0
set / acl interface ethternet-1/1.0 input
set / acl interface ethternet-1/1.0 input acl-filter mirror-acl type ipv4

set / system mirroring
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 admin-state enable
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-source
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-source acl
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-source acl acl-filter mirror-acl type ipv4

set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-destination

set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-destination remote encap l2ogre
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-destination remote network-instance default
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-destination remote tunnel-end-points
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-destination remote tunnel-end-points source-address 10.0.1.2
set / system mirroring mirroring-instance 1 mirror-destination remote tunnel-end-points destination-address 192.168.1.10
```

## Statistics
Statistics about the mirrored traffic can be seen with the following commands.
## Leaf1
```
A:leaf1# info from state interface ethernet-1/10 statistics | filter fields out-mirror-octets out-mirror-packets | as table
+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|      Interface      |  Out-mirror-octets   |  Out-mirror-packets  |
+=====================+======================+======================+
| ethernet-1/10       |                43348 |                  269 |
+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
```

## Leaf2
In this case the statistics can be seen on `ethernet-1/50` since this is the interface leaf2 uses to send traffic to mirror1.
```
A:leaf2# info from state interface ethernet-1/50 statistics | filter fields out-mirror-octets out-mirror-packets | as table
+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
|      Interface      |  Out-mirror-octets   |  Out-mirror-packets  |
+=====================+======================+======================+
| ethernet-1/50       |                  772 |                    6 |
+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
